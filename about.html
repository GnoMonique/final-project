        <h3>What is an art prompt?</h3>
        <p> An art prompt generator is a tool that provides creative ideas or concepts for artists to explore and break the ice creatively. When you're not sure where to start or feel stuck, a quick prompt can be like a small, low-pressure task to get your brain engaged and your artistic flow started. You don’t have to commit to a big project right away; you’re just "warming up" creatively.</p>
        <h3>Set a timer to your practice!</h3>
        <p> Setting a timer when using an art prompt generator can add an exciting layer of structure and challenge to your creative process. By limiting the time for each prompt, you encourage quick thinking and help overcome perfectionism. Aditionally, setting a timer for the art prompt generator can also guarantee that you quickly move through creative exercises and maintain momentum. </p>
